# Proyect Budgeting System for Infratel

Firstly, clone the app in your local machine for editing. (Make sure `npm` is isntalled in your local machine).

Before installing dependcies, install nodemon.
`npm install -g nodemon`

Now, to install the proyect dependencies, run the following command (make sure you are in prespuesto-InfraTel folder)
`npm install`

After this, we have to install the frontend dependicies.
`cd frontend && npm install`

If you're editing scripts in the frontend folder, make sure you run the following command before running the app (inside frontend folder).
`npm run-script build`

To run the app, type the following command in prespuesto-InfraTel folder.
`npm start`

You can now view the app in the following link:

**Note: It is only necessary to run `npm start` one time, as nodemon resarts the server when a file is changed and saved**
